VBS 2018 Logging

  As each tool has its own set of query initialization, filtering and browsing options, the vocabulary of logged actions will consist of generalized unified (mandatory) and tool specific (optional) parts. The unified mandatory part is represented by a capital letter.
  K = keyword search in automatically detected annotations (most teams use DCNNs), use this letter also for automatically detected concepts
  A = using extracted audio data (usually searched by keywords as well)
  O = using optical character recognition (usually searched by keywords as well)
  C = search by color-sketch
  E = search by edge-sketch
  M = search by motion-sketch
  S = query by example similarity search (when users pick an example query object from results or external source)
  F = filtering using various attributes or actual dataset ordering, part of the database is cut off
  P = paging, visiting a next/previous page in the actual ordering
  B = browsing using a tool specific browsing system, e.g., zoom in/out in a hierarchical imagemap
  T = the tool used external results from other team members
  X = whenever you stop the actual search strategy and start from the scratch (reset all)
  - = if you turn off just one action, for example, if you turn off edge-sketch you print -E

  In brackets, additional brief tool-specific details can be provided for each letter, for example K(value, position, annotation source, ...); P(next); B(zoomout); ... If you perform more actions in one step, you can just concatenate them ...; CE; ... represents using color-edge sketch at once or ...; CF(0.2cr); ... represents using only 20% of the ranking by color.

  Few examples of such log messages
  "TID1;K(horse)F(0.3kr);P(next);P(next);time 23:45" telling tool id 1 submitted at 23:45 the sequence: keyword search by "horse" considering just 30% of the dataset, 2x next page, before submit
  "TID1;K(horse)F(0.3kr);C(rerank);time 23:45" telling tool id 1 submitted at 23:45 the sequence: keyword search by "horse" considering just 30% of the dataset and then reranked by color before submit
  "TID1;M;B(zoomin);B(pan);time 23:45" telling tool id 1 submitted at 23:45 the sequence: motion sketch query and then two specific browse actions before submit
  "TID1;M;B(zoomin);B(pan);time 23:45;X;C;P(next);P(next);time 23:47" example of the log for two submissions during one task, user decided to cancel all previous actions by X


  The logging update
  Please provide also the information about the actual second for the submission time attribute
  "TID1;K(horse)F(0.3kr);P(next);P(next);time 23:45:02" = submission at 23 hours, 45 minutes and 2 seconds
  If possible, could you please provide a time stamp info as the first attribute in brackets about each logged action? Time stamp of an action = the number of seconds after the log was resetted
  "TID1;K(12s,horse)F(0.3kr);P(20s,next);P(30s,next);time 23:45:02"


  what WE log:
      - K(keyword)
          - conceptFilter
          - mapFilter (with prefix "map:")
      - C()
          - sketch search
      - S(videoId_frameNumber)
          - similarity search
      - F("dom_color")
          - color filter
      - F(videoId)
          - video shot list
      - B(mapName:level;x,y)
          - browse in feature map
      - V(videoId:firstFrame)
          - open video in video player
